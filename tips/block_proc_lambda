conclusion:
	use block and lambda
	proc is a little discouraged

block: closure(possible to refer the local variable)
x = 10
y = 3
5.times do
	puts x * y
end
# 30, 30, 30

proc: block as object

# example 1
x = 1
y = 1
block = Proc.new { |z| (x+y) * z }
puts block.call(10) # 20

# example 2
x = 1
y = 1
def output(&block)
  block.call * 10
end
puts output { x + y } # 20

lambda: one of the proc
it's different on 'scope on return' and 'error on argument'
